This is a regex problem! EDIT: it is most definitely not!

Solved with 2 different algorithms but feel like there is a better way to do it. Just need to to test for first algothrim based on sort and, if test fails, then run the second algorithm based on associative array. Still, I think there is a better way to do it. EDIT: There is (see below!)

Reviewing other solutions revealed that an earlier, abandoned approach was indeed a much better approach. Had I not given up on this approach out of frustration, I would have solved this kata much morre quickly. I will try to remember this lesson in the future: don't give up on an approach just because it is not working right away!

However, this kata did lead to the use of using paper and pencil to work through the logic and algorithm. I think this is a good habit to get into. I will try to do this more often.
